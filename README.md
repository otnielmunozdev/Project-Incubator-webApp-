# Project-Incubator-webApp-
A system was designed which manages and is responsible for the care of egg incubators, 
which are comprised of two applications (web page and mobile application), 
through the website we present our service and information on incubators and care of the same as the eggs, 
in it the clients enter their account to verify the status of their egg in the incubator, 
showing data and statistics of temperature, humidity, days of incubation, in addition to the administrator who is in charge 
of the part administrative (CRUD operations), the mobile is oriented to the workers which warns if there is any problem with 
the egg or the incubator in particular. For this project it was used in the web part HTML5, CSS3 (Boopstrap), JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, PHP, 
and for the mobile part the Java language was used, while the Databases were programmed in SQL and were mounted in two independent servers. 
Being one of the most complete projects made in the race. In this code the web application (front-end / back-end) is shown. 
In the part of the user account you can see the temperature record of the incubator according to time by graphs and thermometers in real time.
